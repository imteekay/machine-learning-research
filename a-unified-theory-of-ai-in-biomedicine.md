## How Cells Work

- DNA: it's molecule with double helix shape
  - Group of pairs of nucleotides adenine and thymine (AT) or guanine and cytosine (GC)
  - The nucleotides carry the genetic information
- RNA
  - It has individual strands (compared to the double strands from the DNA)
  - It uses uracil as a replacement the thymine
- Proteins
  - They are biomolecules represented as chains of amino-acids (20 types of amino acids with different chemical properties)
  - Types of roles: structural, catalyzer (chemical reactions)
  - They can receive signals, transfort molecules, break down sugar, replicate DNA
  - Hundreds or thousands of amino acids folded into 3-dimensional structures
  - Protein shapes and functions are not static, which makes it even more complex

## Central Dogma of Biology

DNA -> RNA -> Protein

## Proteins

- understand proteins, to understand cells, to build virtual cells

## Current challenges in biology

- Fundamental Problems in Protein Function and Annotation
  - Misannotation: 80% of protein families are wrongly annotated
  - Difficulty in Discovering Truly Unknown Functions: ML models fail on anything that is truly new because the function is not in the training set. Better used as "labeling" tools
  - The Importance of Context: To define function correctly, one needs both the molecular function and the biological context
- Systemic, Funding, and Infrastructure Challenges
  - Absence of Data Publication Standards
  - Lack of Incentives for Data Curation
  - Critical Underfunding of Databases
- Challenges in Applying AI to Biology
  - Neglect of Foundational Data Work: doing the essential, foundational work of ensuring datasets are thoughtfully constructed and splits (training/test) are well-designed
  - Biological Impossibility in Predictions: Applying AI without domain expertise can lead to biologically impossible or thermodynamically impossible conclusions
  - Data Leakage: e.g. fail to remove proteins of unknown function from the training set, allowing information to leak between the training and test data
- Help biologists and scientists to design better experiments
  - The model doesn't need to be super accurate, but it needs to help lab people design better experiments
  - e.g. chatgpt to as about research question like "should I look at this set of proteins?" or "what tissue should I look at?", or "how should I design my experiment?"
- Vision models vs human eyes for microscopy images of cells
  - Microscopy images are very rich in information
  - Vision models can interpret more information than human eyes

  - Optimizing trial efficiency
  - Diagnosis in pathology and radiology
  - Prognosis and output prediction
  - Precision oncology
  - Drug development
  - Diagnostics and treatment improvement leading to better health economic outcome: enhanced health results coupled with reduced costs
