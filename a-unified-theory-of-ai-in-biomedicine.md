## Current challenges in biology

- Fundamental Problems in Protein Function and Annotation
  - Misannotation: 80% of protein families are wrongly annotated
  - Difficulty in Discovering Truly Unknown Functions: ML models fail on anything that is truly new because the function is not in the training set. Better used as "labeling" tools
  - The Importance of Context: To define function correctly, one needs both the molecular function and the biological context
- Systemic, Funding, and Infrastructure Challenges
  - Absence of Data Publication Standards
  - Lack of Incentives for Data Curation
  - Critical Underfunding of Databases
- Challenges in Applying AI to Biology
  - Neglect of Foundational Data Work: doing the essential, foundational work of ensuring datasets are thoughtfully constructed and splits (training/test) are well-designed
  - Biological Impossibility in Predictions: Applying AI without domain expertise can lead to biologically impossible or thermodynamically impossible conclusions
  - Data Leakage: e.g. fail to remove proteins of unknown function from the training set, allowing information to leak between the training and test data
- Help biologists and scientists to design better experiments
  - The model doesn't need to be super accurate, but it needs to help lab people design better experiments
  - e.g. chatgpt to as about research question like "should I look at this set of proteins?" or "what tissue should I look at?", or "how should I design my experiment?"

## Proteins

- understand proteins, to understand cells, to build virtual cells
