His days revolved around the sunbeams that dappled his favorite armchair, the precise cadence of kibble hitting his ceramic bowl, and the strategic napping locations that offered optimal warmth and minimal disturbance. Yet, beneath his placid exterior, a flicker of something wild stirred.\n",
      "\n",
      "It began with a dream. A dream of emerald forests, of chattering squirrels that weren’t safely behind glass, and of a moon so vast it seemed to whisper secrets only to him. Whisker awoke with a twitch of his tail and a rumble in his chest that was more than just contentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The catalyst for his adventure arrived on a Tuesday, disguised as a rogue butterfly. It was a creature of improbable color, with wings like stained glass, that dared to flit past his windowpane, taunting him with its freedom. Whisker’s hunter’s instinct, long dormant, flared. He paced, he yowled, he batted at the air with uncharacteristic ferocity. The butterfly, alas, was too quick.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, under the benevolent gaze of the very moon from his dream, Whisker made a decision. He nudged the back door with his head, a maneuver he'd perfected for emergencies (like a late dinner). To his surprise, it creaked open.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world outside was a symphony of new sensations. The air, cool and damp, carried the scent of dewy grass and distant, intriguing aromas. His paws, accustomed to plush carpets, sank into the soft earth. He felt a thrill, a delicious apprehension, prickle his fur.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first obstacle was the fence. It loomed like a formidable mountain range. But the dream had given him courage. He bunched his muscles, sprang, and with a surprising grace, landed on the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in the garden next door. It was a jungle to his discerning feline eyes. Towering hollyhocks were ancient trees, their blossoms vibrant, exotic flowers. A scurrying beetle became a dragon. He stalked it, his belly low to the ground, his tail a silent, flicking radar. The beetle, however, proved surprisingly agile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deeper into the unknown he ventured. He discovered a hidden patch of catnip, a veritable Shangri-La of sensory delight. He rolled and purred, his mind blissfully adrift in fragrant bliss. He was no longer Whisker, the pampered housecat. He was a primal being, connected to the earth, to the hunt, to the wild call of his ancestors.\n",
      "\n",
      "He encountered a grumpy badger, who eyed him with suspicion. Whisker, remembering the tales whispered by the wind in his dreams, puffed himself up to appear twice his size and let out a hiss that surprised even himself. The badger, perhaps intimidated by such audacity, grumbled and retreated.\n",
      "\n",
      "As dawn began to paint the sky in hues of rose and gold, Whisker found himself at the edge of a small, babbling brook. He’d never seen such a thing, only the sterile reflection in his water dish. He dipped a tentative paw, the water cool and refreshing. He watched a tiny fish dart beneath the surface, a fleeting silver gleam. He felt a strange longing, a curiosity about what lay beyond this sparkling barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, a familiar sound cut through the morning chorus. A soft, melodic whistle. It was Sarah, his human, searching for him, her voice tinged with worry.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pang of something akin to guilt, but also a deep-seated understanding of comfort and belonging, tugged at Whisker. He looked back at the brook, at the whispering trees, at the world that had offered him such a thrilling glimpse of freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, with a final, lingering glance, he turned and trotted back. He navigated the familiar landscape, his senses now sharper, his understanding of his own territory deepened by his brief foray into the wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "He slipped back through the still-ajar back door, a silent shadow. Sarah, her face etched with relief, scooped him up. “Oh, Whisker! Where have you been, you naughty boy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whisker purred, a deep, rumbling sound that vibrated with the secrets of his adventure. He couldn’t tell her about the emerald forests, the chattering squirrels, or the grumpy badger. But as he settled back into his armchair, the sunbeam warm on his fur, he knew something had changed. He was still Whiskerton III, the cat of refined habits. But now, he carried within him the whisper of the wild, the memory of an extraordinary night, and the quiet knowledge that even the most comfortable of lives could hold the seeds of a grand adventure. And perhaps, just perhaps, he would dream of that brook again.\n"

       "This file is a **shell script** (specifically written for `bash` and `zsh` shells) that provides a **highly customizable Git prompt**.\n",
       "\n",
       "## What is it?\n",
       "\n",
       "At a very high level, this file is the core logic for a tool often called \"Bash Git Prompt\" (or similar names). Its purpose is to **enhance your command line prompt (`PS1`)** to display real-time information about your current Git repository.\n",
       "\n",
       "Instead of just showing your current directory, this script integrates Git status, branch names, and other relevant details directly into your prompt, making it much more informative.\n",
       "\n",
       "## What does it do?\n",
       "\n",
       "When sourced (loaded) into your shell (typically from your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file), this script does the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Hooks into your shell's prompt mechanism:** It modifies the `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable (in bash) or similar mechanisms (in zsh) so that a special function (`setGitPrompt`) is run *before* every new prompt is displayed.\n",
       "2.  **Detects Git repositories:** When you navigate to a directory that is part of a Git repository, it detects this.\n",
       "3.  **Gathers Git status:** It then runs `git` commands (e.g., `git status`, `git rev-parse`) to determine:\n",
       "    *   Your current branch name.\n",
       "    *   If you're in a detached HEAD state.\n",
       "    *   If there are staged, unstaged, conflicting, or untracked changes.\n",
       "    *   If your local branch is ahead of, behind, or has diverged from its remote counterpart.\n",
       "    *   If there are stashed changes.\n",
       "4.  **Constructs a rich prompt string:** Based on the gathered Git information, it dynamically creates a new `PS1` (your prompt string). This prompt typically includes:\n",
       "    *   The current branch name.\n",
       "    *   Symbols or counts indicating pending changes (e.g., `*` for unstaged, `+` for staged, `~` for conflicts).\n",
       "    *   Indicators for ahead/behind remote (e.g., `↑` for ahead, `↓` for behind).\n",
       "    *   Color-coding to make the information easy to read and distinguish.\n",
       "5.  **Supports Themes and Customization:** It loads color definitions and themes from other files (like `prompt-colors.sh` and various `.bgptheme` files), allowing you to customize the look and feel of your Git prompt. You can even create your own custom themes.\n",
       "6.  **Integrates with Virtual Environments:** It can also display the name of your active Python `virtualenv`, `conda` environment, or `node` virtual environment in the prompt.\n",
       "7.  **Asynchronous Operations:** It includes functions (`async_run`, `async_run_zsh`) to perform non-blocking `git fetch` operations in the background, so your prompt stays updated with remote changes without slowing down your terminal.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Why would I use it?\n",
       "\n",
       "You would use this file to:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Get Instant Git Context:** Without typing `git status`, you immediately know which branch you're on, if you have pending changes (staged, unstaged, conflicts), and your local branch's relationship to its remote.\n",
       "*   **Boost Productivity:** Save time and mental effort by having critical Git information constantly visible, reducing the need to frequently run Git commands to check your status.\n",
       "*   **Prevent Mistakes:** Easily see if you're on the wrong branch before committing, or if you have unpushed changes that need to be synchronized.\n",
       "*   **Enhance Terminal Aesthetics:** Make your terminal more informative and visually appealing with color-coded Git details.\n",
       "*   **Stay Informed about Virtual Environments:** If you work with multiple Python, Node, or Conda projects, it clearly shows which environment is currently active.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, it turns your otherwise basic shell prompt into a powerful dashboard for your Git workflow."
