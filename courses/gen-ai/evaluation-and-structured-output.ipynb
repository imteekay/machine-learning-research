       "1.  **Model Architecture:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is a **sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer-based model**. This architecture builds upon the research advances and multimodal capabilities of Gemini 1.0 models. MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters, allowing for a large total parameter count while keeping the activated parameters constant for any given input, which contributes to its compute efficiency.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Hardware and Software Infrastructure:**\n",
       "    *   It is trained on **multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators**, distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "    *   The training leverages **JAX** (a numerical computing library) and **ML Pathways** (Google's effort to build generalizable AI systems). JAX, powered by XLA, and including the GSPMD partitioner, enables automatic parallelization for efficient training on large models.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Model Initialization:** The model is trained from a **random initialization**.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Training Data and Phases:**\n",
       "    *   **Pre-training:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is pre-trained on a **variety of multimodal and multilingual data**. This dataset includes content sourced across many different domains, such as web documents, code, and incorporates image, audio, and video content.\n",
       "    *   **Instruction-tuning (Fine-tuning):** After pre-training, the model undergoes an instruction-tuning phase. It is fine-tuned on a collection of **multimodal data containing paired instructions and corresponding desired responses**.\n",
       "    *   **Human Preference Tuning:** Further tuning is performed based on **human preference data**.\n",
       "    *   **Safety Mitigations:** For responsible deployment and safety, the model incorporates mitigations through **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** and **reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF)** using a reward model. This safety training specifically targets adversarial or \"harm-inducing\" queries. A significant update in 1.5 Pro's mitigation is the incorporation of new image-to-text SFT data.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Efficiency:** A key aspect of Gemini 1.5 Pro is its **high compute efficiency** for both training and serving, allowing it to achieve performance comparable to or surpassing Gemini 1.0 Ultra while requiring significantly less training compute.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, Gemini 1.5 Pro is a large, multimodal MoE Transformer model, trained from scratch on a vast and diverse dataset using Google's advanced TPU infrastructure, and then fine-tuned with instruction data and human feedback, including specific safety mitigations."

       "    *   This happens on super-duper fast computers, like thousands of them, all working together in big rooms!\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Give it Special Lessons (Fine-tuning):**\n",
       "    *   After it's learned a lot from everything, we give it special homework. We show it examples of questions and good answers, or tell it to translate a new language by giving it a grammar book.\n",
       "    *   This is like when your teacher gives you practice problems to make sure you really understand. We even have people tell the robot brain if its answers are good or if they need to be better.\n",

       "3.  **Teach it to be Kind and Safe (Safety Training):**\n",
       "    *   And because we want Gemini to be a good helper, we also teach it to be *kind* and *safe*. We show it what's a good thing to say and what's not, just like your parents teach you to use your words nicely and not to say bad things.\n",

It includes specific percentages, comparisons with other models, and concrete examples from the document. Response A, in contrast, offers only a very brief, high-level summary.\n",

The `answer_question` and `eval_pairwise` functions are [memoized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) to avoid unnecessarily regenerating the same answers or evaluations, so you should see this complete quickly unless you have changed the questions, prompts or number of iterations from the earlier steps."

    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse."
