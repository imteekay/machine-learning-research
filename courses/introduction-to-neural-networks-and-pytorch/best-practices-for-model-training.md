# Best Practices for Training Linear Regression Models in PyTorch

- **Learning Rate**: Setting a moderate initial learning rate (e.g., 0.01) and utilizing learning rate schedulers for dynamic adjustments during training.
- **Data Standardization**: Scaling input features to have zero mean and unit variance to improve training speed and accuracy. Normalizing the output may also be beneficial.
- **Validation Sets**: Implementing train-validation splits and using early stopping based on validation loss to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
- **Gradient Clipping**: Applying gradient clipping to limit the magnitude of gradients, especially in datasets with high variance, to ensure training stability and prevent exploding gradients.
- **Loss Function Monitoring**: Observing the loss function's reduction during training and using visualization tools like TensorBoard to track training and validation loss over epochs for better diagnostics and adjustments.
