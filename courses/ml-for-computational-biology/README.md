# ML for Computational Biology

## Why Computational Biology?

- High volume of data
- The iterative process of hypothesis generation, testing, and refinement becomes far more efficient when supported by computational models
- Computation allows us to decipher the language of biology, translating sequences into functional molecules, protein interactions, and phenotypes.
- Computational models help to distill the signal from the noise, allowing researchers to extract meaningful insights from complex, high-dimensional data.

## Why GenAI changes biology?

- Representation learning: from pattern recognition to meaning within biological data
- Generative AI: foundation models
  - Foundation models are trained by hiding parts of their input and learning to predict the missing pieces without relying on human-annotaded dat.
  - Understanding Biology:
    - Language of protein folding
    - Language of genomes
    - Language of disease and health
- Learn patterns in the genome using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - One-hot encoding of ACGT: a matrix or an image representation of genome sequences (2D images)
- Learn relationships using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
