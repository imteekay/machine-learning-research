# Interview Prep

## Tips to how to prepare

- It’s important to be able to explain algorithms and ML concepts at two levels: on a simple “explain like I’m five years old” level and at a deeper, technical level, one more appropriate for a college course. 
- Be prepared to answer follow-up questions to these ML algorithm interview questions.

## Type of questions

### Pre-processing

- How do you deal with the challenges that come with an imbalanced dataset?

### Model Training

- Tell me about the bias-variance trade-off
- What is L1 versus L2 regularization?
  - Follow up question: What other types of regularization could work?
