# Learning the Logic of DNA

- Based on a DNA sequence, predict if it's bound by transcrition factors (TFs â€” class of proteins)
  - TFs are related to gene regulation
  - TFs bind to a DNA sequence and make surrounding genes to be turned on or off
- Biology Primer
  - DNA is a molecule of inheritance
  - DNA of a cell has all the instructions to build an entire human body
  - DNA is built from 4 unique letter, or nucleotides (A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), and T (thymine))
  - It holds processes like cell division and differentiation
  - Genome is a complete set of DNA in an organism
    - Genetics: study specific genes or small set of genes
    - Genomics: study an entire genome
