# Research Ideas

## Ideas

- Developing fusion strategies for Multi-Omics Data
- Integrating genomic data (mutations, variants) with proteomics (protein expression/modification), clinical records (EHR, symptoms), and imaging data
- Analyze the interactions between genes, proteins, and clinical factors within biological networks

## Goals

- Precision Medicine
  - Multimodal: generalize across multiple types of data
- Specialized Tools and Models
  - U-net for image segmentation
  - Transformer-based models for protein structure prediction
  - GNN pathaways classification (gene activity)
