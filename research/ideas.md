# Research Ideas

## Ideas

- Developing fusion strategies for Multi-Omics Data
- Integrating genomic data (mutations, variants) with proteomics (protein expression/modification), clinical records (EHR, symptoms), and imaging data
- Analyze the interactions between genes, proteins, and clinical factors within biological networks

## Foundation

- Biology is not "just another modality". It's not "Biology is text + images + graphs. Just scale transformers"
- Biology is causal, hierarchical, stochastic, and incomplete in ways that language and vision are not
- Most biological signals are not supervised problems. They are intervention-driven problems. They demand perturbations, counterfactuals, and mechanisms, beyond just prediction
- Scaling = correlation. We need causal structure. Biological foundation models must be built around perturbation, uncertainty, and actionability, not just representation learning

## Goals

- Precision Medicine
  - Multimodal: generalize across multiple types of data
  - Agentic AI: experimentation, simulation, and decision-making
- Specialized Tools and Models
  - U-net for image segmentation
  - Transformer-based models for protein structure prediction
  - GNN pathaways classification (gene activity)
